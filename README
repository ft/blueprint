blueprint - An incomplete implementation of R7RS Scheme
-------------------------------------------------------

Very much incomplete for now. At the moment  this is just a proof of concept of
an imcomplete  parser and  an incomplete  environment-passing interpreter  of a
very small part of  Scheme. The blueprint program reads a  program from a file,
parses it, evaluates it and prints the result.

    % stack init
    % stack build
    % stack run -- example.scm
    (define fact (lambda (n)
                   (if (< n 2)
                     1
                     (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
    (fact 10)
     â†’ Atom (ScmInteger 3628800)

You got to start somewhere. ;)
